# React Practice

I may be doing some class component react stuff soon so I'm just gonna see if I can make a quick app to review it

## How to run the app to check my work

1. Clone this repo
2. In your terminal type `cd client` to go into the react app
3. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install all needed dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the app

you did it :)
